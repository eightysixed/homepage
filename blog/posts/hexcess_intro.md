### Introduction

Let me introduce my new baby to you, hexcess! It's a TUI hex viewer, and soon
editor as I'm still working on it! The edit feature will (probably) be
available next week! It was initially a project idea I had when I was
participating in some CTF and I needed to modify some file signatures to be
able to open the file.

### Why C and Ncurses

I initially wanted to write it in Rust with the [Ratatui](https://ratatui.rs/)
library, however I ended up using C and Ncurses instead. Why ?

1. Because I still haven't read the Rust book, so I don't feel comfortable
making a project using a language I'm not familiar enough with. Learning how
to correctly use the language and being familiar with the good practices before
coding is something very important to me.

2. Although it got a little bit rusty, I used to program a lot in C when I was
at School 19. Even though I had trouble remembering how to write a correct
Makefile, Includes files, and how to use GCC correctly to compile with the
library and use the flags to detect potential errors, I found my way through
the depths of my memory and how to write code in C.

3. As an aspiring Reverse Engineer myself, I want to get used again to C to be
able to understand the decompiled code generated by Ghidra or IDA.

4. I'm trying to apply for an internship at a nice company where C is heavily
used (I hope they take me in)! This project is a nice way to highlight my
skills in this language I guess ?

### My experience using C again

It's been a while since I programmed in C, and one thing I had a hard time
to get used to again is to make sure that I write secure code. I can't count
how many times my program went out of bounds from the memory I allocated. This
is probably a skill issue from my part, and a more experienced C programmer
would probably make sure that the program never reads a single byte of memory
past what it's supposed to have access to, but I think it's very easy to be
distracted and not handle this correctly. I would have preferred to use a
memory-safe and blazingly fastâ„¢ language like Rust. Maybe I will rewrite the
this program in Rust sometimes!

### Discovering Ncurses

Ncurses is quite simple and straightforward in my opinion, I still had a hard
time starting to use this library correctly. There are some nice tutorials
around, like this one from [https://tldp.org/HOWTO/NCURSES-Programming-HOWTO/](https://tldp.org/HOWTO/NCURSES-Programming-HOWTO/),
but I wasn't sure if I should use it since it hasn't been updated since 2005,
I used it anyway since it was really well written and in-depth, along with
the Ncurses man, because RTFM. In comparison, when I tried using Ratatui, I
had a better experience learning the library thanks to the tutorial included in
their website. I really recommend checking it out!

### Conclusion

I still liked making this project, although I didn't plan on taking such a long
time to write the code for it. Now that I have commited myself to writing this
project in C and Ncurses, I will stick to it and try to push this project as
far as I can! [Here](https://github.com/jeanmadao/hexcess) is the link to the
